# Advanced Functions Notes
PDFs in Releases, should be updated after every lesson

## Contribution Rules:
Don't leave too much whitespace  
Always use `\left` and `\right` brackets  
Tabs to indent, spaces to align things in the code (but you should never do this anyways)  
Use `` and '' (or " technically) for quotes
