	\subsubsection{Relations}
	A (binary) relation is defined as a set of ordered pairs $(x,\,y)$. A relation can be described using:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item words
		\item graphs
		\item equations
		\item inequalities
		\item lists of ordered pairs
		\item mapping diagrams
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.75]
		\begin{axis}[
			scatter/classes={a={draw=red,fill=red}},
			axis y line*=left,
			axis x line*=bottom,
			grid=both,
			ymin=0,
			xmin=0,
			ymax=4.5,
			xmax=5.5,
			axis equal,
			axis lines=middle,
			xlabel=$x$,
			ylabel=$y$,
			xtick distance=1,
			ytick distance=1
		]
		\addplot[scatter,only marks,scatter src=explicit symbolic]
		table[meta=label] {
			x y label
			2 2 a
			2 4 a
			4 1 a
			5 4 a
		};
		\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	This relation as a set of ordered pairs is $R=\set{(2,\,2),\,(2,\,4),\,(4,\,1),(5,\,4)}$
	\subsubsection{Domain and Range of a Function}
	The domain of a relation is the set of all the x values such that the ordered pair $(x, y)$ satisfies (is an element of) the relation. The range of a relation is the set of all the y values such that the ordered pair $(x,\,y)$ satisfies (is an element of) the relation.\\\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]
		\node (n3) {-3};
		\node[below=2pt of n3] (n2) {-2};
		\node[below=2pt of n2] (o) {0};
		\node[below=2pt of o] (p1) {1};
		\node[below=2pt of p1] (p2) {2};
		
		\node[right=45pt of o] (o2) {0};
		\node[above=4pt of o2] (nn1) {-1};
		\node[below=4pt of o2] (pp1) {1};
		
		\draw[->] (n3) -- (nn1);
		\draw[->] (n2) -- (o2);
		\draw[->] (o) -- (nn1);
		\draw[->] (p1) -- (pp1);
		\draw[->] (p2) -- (pp1);
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	For this mapping diagram, the domain would be $D=\set{-3,\,-2,\,0,\,1,\,2}$ and the range would be $R=\set{-1,\,0,\,1}$
	\subsubsection{Functions}
	A function can only assign one element from the set of Y values (the range) to each element from the set of X values (the domain). $y=f(x)$ where $x$ is the argument or the input of the function and $y$ is the value or the output of the function.\\
	Using the function $f(x)=(x-1)^2$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $f(0)=1$
		\item $f(\frac{1}{2})=\frac{1}{4}$
		\item $f(a+2)=a^2+2a+1$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Graph}
	The graph of a function $f$ is the graph of the set of ordered pairs $(x,\,y)$ where $y=f(x)$.\\
	The graph of the function defined by a set of ordered pairs $f=\{(2,\,3),\,(0,\,-2),\,(-4,\,3),\,(4,\,0),\,(-3,\,-3)\}$:\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.75]
		\begin{axis}[
			scatter/classes={a={draw=red,fill=red}},
			axis y line*=left,
			axis x line*=bottom,
			grid=both,
			ymin=-4,
			xmin=-5,
			ymax=4,
			xmax=5,
			axis equal,
			axis lines=middle,
			xlabel=$x$,
			ylabel=$y$,
			xtick distance=1,
			ytick distance=1
		]
		%TODO: Fix this so that the points are still red (Change the label something)
		\addplot[mark=*,scatter,only marks,scatter src=explicit symbolic,nodes near coords={\labelz}, visualization depends on={value {\small$(\thisrowno{0}, \thisrowno{1})$}\as\labelz}]
		table[meta=label] {
			x y label
			2 3 a
			0 -2 a
			-4 3 a
			4 0 a
			-3 -3 a
		};
		\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\subsubsection{Vertical Line Test}
	All functions are relations but not all relations are functions. A graph represents a function if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.\\
	The set of ordered pairs $\set{(0,\,0),\,(-1,\,-1),\,(2,\,2),\,(1,\,-1)}$ represents a function, while the set of ordered pairs $\set{(2,\,3),\,(-1,\,3),\,(2,\,-2),\,(-3,\,-1)}$ does not.
	%TODO: The actual graphs with vertical lines
	\subsubsection{Domain and Range}
	The domain of a function $f$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ for which $f(x)$ is defined. The range of a function $f$ is the set of all real numbers $y$ for which $y=f(x)$  is defined.\\
	The domain and range for the set of ordered pairs $\set{(-2,\,0),\,(-1,\,1),\,(0,\,-1),\,(1,\,0)}$ is $D=\set{-2,\,-1,\,0,\,1}$ and $\set{-1, 0, 1}$. The domain and range for the set of ordered pairs $\set{(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 1), (7, 0)}$ is $D=\set{-1, 0, 1, 3, 7}$ and $\set{0, 1}$.
	%TODO: Graphs with domain and range
	\subsubsection{Restrictions}
	Division by 0 is undefined, so the denominator of a function cannot equal 0. Square roots are undefined for negative numbers and square roots cannot be negative, so for $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$, $x\geq0$ and $f(x)\geq0$. Squares cannot be negative so for $f(x)=x^2$, $f(x)\geq0$.\\
	For $y=(x-1)^2-3$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $D=\{x\in R\}$
		\item $R=\{y\in R\mid y\geq-3\}$
	\end{itemize}
	For $y=2+\sqrt{x-3}$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $D=\{x\in R\mid x\geq3\}$
		\item $R=\{y\in R\mid y\geq2\}$
	\end{itemize}
	For $y=\frac{x-2}{x+2}$: $=\frac{x+2-4}{x+2}$ $=1-\frac{4}{x+2}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $D=\{x\in R\mid x\neq-2\}$
		\item $R=\{y\in R\mid y\neq1\}$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Exploring Absolute Value}
	\subsubsection{Absolute Value}
	The absolute value $|x|$ of a real number $x$ is the distance between $x$ and 0.\\
	For example, $|5|=|-5|=5$ and $\left|2-\left|-3\right|\right|=1$.
	\subsubsection{Definition of Absolute Value}
	The absolute value $|x|$ is defined by:
	\[|x|=\begin{cases}
		x&\text{if }x\geq0\\
		-x&\text{if }x<0
	\end{cases}\]
	Therefore:
	\[|x-3|=\begin{cases}
		x-3&\text{if }x\geq3\\
		-x+3&\text{if }x<3
	\end{cases}\]
	\subsubsection{Properties of Absolute Value}
	Absolute values have the following properties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $|a|=|-a|$
		\item if $|a|=0$, $a=0$
		\item $|ab|=|a||b|$
		\item $\left|\frac{a}{b}\right|=\frac{|a|}{|b|}$
		\item $|a+b|\leq|a|+|b|$ (proved by triangle inequality)
	\end{itemize}
	For example, $\left|\frac{-2x}{3y}\right|\left|\frac{-2y}{3x}\right|=\frac{|-2||x|}{|3||y|}\cdot\frac{|-2||y|}{|3||x|}=\frac{4}{9}$. Also, $|-3x|-|-x|-|x|=3|x|-|x|-|x|=|x|$
	\subsubsection{Distance between two numbers}
	The distance between two numbers $a$ and $b$ on the number line can be represented by $|a-b|$.
	For example, in the equation $|x-3|=|5-x|$, $x$ would represent a number that is the same distance from 3 as is to 5. This can be solved algebraically:
	\begin{align*}
		&&x-3&=\pm(5-x)\\
		\text{Ca}&\text{se 1}&&&\text{Ca}&\text{se 2}\\
		x-3&=5-x&&&x-3&=x-5\\
		2x&=8&&&-3&=-5\\
		x&=4&&&\text{No }&\text{Solution}\\
		&&\therefore{}&x=4
	\end{align*}
	\subsubsection{Equations}
	If $E(x)$ is an algebraic expression containing the variable $x$, the equation $|E(x)|=a; a\geq0$ can be solved from isolating $x$ from the equation $E(x)=\pm a$\\
	For example, from the equation $\left|2-\frac{2x+1}{2x-1}\right|=1$:
	\begin{align*}
		\left|\frac{(4x-2)-(2x+1)}{2x-1}\right|&=1;x\neq\frac{1}{2}\\
		\frac{2x-3}{2x-1}&=\pm1\\
		\begin{cases}
			2x-3\\
			2x-3
		\end{cases}&\\
		\text{Not Done Yet but}
	\end{align*}
	\subsubsection{Absolute Value Function}
	The absolute value function is defined by y=f(x)=|x|
	%graph
	\subsubsection{Inequalities}
	The comparison operators are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $<$ (less)
		\item $\leq$ (less than or equal to)
		\item $=$ (equal to)
		\item $\neq$ (not equal to)
		\item $>$ (greater than)
		\item $\geq$ (greater than or equal to)
	\end{itemize}
	The non equality comparison operators are used to create inequalities
	\subsubsection{Interval Notation}
	The following notations are equivalent and represent sets of numbers:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $a<x\leqslant b$ (inequality notation)
		\item $x\in[a,b)$ (interval notation)
		\item $\set{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid a<x\leqslant b}$
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
		\node[above] (a) at (1,0) {$a$};
		\node[above] (b) at (2,0) {$b$};
		\node[below left] (x) at (3,0) {$x$};
		\draw[->] (0,0) -- (3,0);
		\filldraw (2,0) circle[radius=2pt];
		\draw[thick] (1,0) -- (2,0);
		\draw[fill=white] (1,0) circle[radius=2pt];
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\subsubsection{Transformations}
	Given a parent function $f$, we can create new functions using transformations: $f(x)=af(b(x-c))+d$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There is a vertical stretch by a factor of $a$
		\item If $a<0$, there is reflection in the x-axis
		\item There is a horizontal stretch by a factor of $b$
		\item If $b<0$, there is a reflection in the y-axis
		\item There is a horizontal translation by $c$
		\item There is a vertical translation by $d$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Properties of Graphs of Functions}
	\subsubsection{Domain and Range}
	The domain of a function is the set of all $x$ values where the function is defined. The range of a function is the set of all $y$ values such that $y=f(x)$
	\subsubsection{X and Y Intercepts}
	The x-intercepts are the $x$ values such that $f(x)=0$. The y-intercepts are the $y$ values such that $y=f(0)$, if it exists
	\subsubsection{Intervals of Increase or Decrease (Turning Points)}
	The function increases if the slope of the tangent line is positive (the graph is going right and up). The function decreases if the slope of the tangent line is negative (the graph is going right and down). A turning point is a point where the functionchanges from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.
	\subsubsection{Maximum and Minimum Points}
	The point $(a,\,f(a))$ is a maximum point if $f(a)\geqslant f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=a$. The point $(a,\,f(a))$ is a minimum point of $f(a)\leqslant f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=a$.
	\subsubsection{Odd and Even Functions}
	The function $f$ is even if $f(x)=f(-x)$ (the graph is symmetric about the y-axis. The function $f$ is odd if $f(-x)=-f(x)$ (the graph is symmetric about the origin
	\subsubsection{Continuous and Discontinuous Functions}
	The graph of a continuous function can be drawn without lifting pencil from paper. A continuous functionhas no holes, finite gaps (jumps), or infinite breaks.
	\subsubsection{Vertical and Horionztal Asymptotes}
	The vertical line $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote if the $y$ values become unbounded (approach infinity) in the neighborhood of $x=a$. The horizontal line $y=a$ is a horizontal asymptote if the values of $y$ become close to $a$ as $x$ becomes unbounded (approaches infinity)
	\subsubsection{Horzontal and Vertical Tangent Lines}
	The graph of a function may have points where the tangent line is horizontal (slope is zero) or vertical (slope is unbounded/approaches infinity)
	\subsubsection{End Behavior}
	The end behavior is related to the $y$ values as $x$ becomes unbounded (approaches infinity)
	\subsubsection{Concavity Upward and Downward}
	The graph of a function has a concavity upward if the graph lies above all its tangents. The graph of a function has a concavity downward if the graph lies below all its tangents
	\subsubsection{Corner, Cusp, and Infinite Slope Points}
	A corner point is a point with two distinct tangent lines. A cusp point is a turning point with a vertical tangent line. An infinite slope point is a non turning point with a vertical tangent line.
	\subsubsection{Periodic Functions}
	A function is periodic if there exists $T$ such that $f(x+T)=f(x)$
	\subsubsection{Axis of Symmetry}
	The graph of a function has an axis of symmetry $x=a$ if the graph is symmetric about the vertical line $x=a$. The sine and cosine functions have an axis defined by $y=(y_{\text{max}}+y+{\text{min}})/2$
	\subsection{Sketching Graphs of Functions}
	\subsubsection{Parent Functions}
	Parent functions are functions in ``simplest form''. Parent functions may be used to create more complicated functions. For example, the function $g(x)=-2\dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}+3$ is a transformation of the parent function $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2}$. Parent functions can be graphed with key points. For example, five key points of the parent function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ are $(-8, -2)$, $(-1, -1)$, $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, and $(8, 2)$.
	%TODO: maybe some examples?
	\subsubsection{Transformations}
	Given a parent function $f(x)$, we can create new functions using the transformations $g(x)=af(b(x-c))+d$. The graph is:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item vertically stretched by $|a|$
		\item reflected on the $x$ axis if $a<0$
		\item horizontally stretched by $\left|\dfrac{1}{b}\right|$
		\item reflected on the $y$ axis if $b<0$
		\item shifted to the right by $c$
		\item shifted up by $d$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Mapping Formulas}
	By comparing the parent function $y=f(x)$ and the image (new) function $y'=af(b(x'-c))+d$, we get:
	\[\begin{cases} 
	y'=ay+d\\
	x'=\dfrac{x}{b}+c
	\end{cases}\]
	%TODO: examples
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{axis}[
			scatter/classes={f={draw=red,fill=red},g={draw=blue,fill=blue}},
			axis y line*=left,
			axis x line*=bottom,
			grid=both,
			ymin=-5,
			xmin=-10,
			ymax=10,
			xmax=10,
			axis equal,
			axis lines=middle,
			xlabel=$x$,
			ylabel=$y$,
			xtick distance=2,
			ytick distance=2
		]
		\addplot[scatter,scatter src=explicit symbolic]
		table[meta=label] {
			x y label
			-6 0 f
			-4 -3 f
			-1 3 f
			
			-1 5 g
			6 7 g
			10 6 g
		};
		\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	To write the function $g(x)$ in the form $g(x)=af(b(x-c))+d$, we have to solve for all 4 of the variables, with 4 equations from the graph. We can know which point corresponds to which point because each segment will have the same proportions. Therefore, we can use these four equations (there are other possibilities):
	\begin{align*}
		something\\something\\something\\something
	\end{align*}
	\subsubsection{Domain and Range}
	After transformations, the domain and range may be changed. The mapping formulas can be used to calculate the new ones.\\
	For example: A function with domain $D=(-1,3]$ and range $R=[2,\infty)$ is transformed into a new function $g(x)=-2f(2x-3)+4$. $a=-2$, $b=2$, $c=\frac{3}{2}$, $d=4$. The domain would be shifted to $\left(\frac{-1}{2}+\frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}+\frac{3}{2}\right]=(1,3]$ and the range would be shifted to $\left[-2(2)+4, -2(\infty)+4\right)=[0, -\infty)$
	\subsection{Inverse Relations}
	\subsubsection{Inverse Relation}
	For any relation there is an inverse relation obtained by switching the $x$ and $y$ values for all the elements of the original relation. The inverse relation of a relation $r$ is denoted by $r^{-1}$. A 1:1 function is a function where the inverse is also a function; it passes both the vertical and horizontal line tests.\\
	The inverse relation of the relation $r=\set{(1, 2), (1, 0), (-2, 1), (0, 2)}$ is $r^{-1}=\set{(2, 1), (0, 1), (1, -2), (2, 0)}$
	\subsubsection{Symmetry}
	The graph of a relation and the graph of its inverse relation are symmetrical about the line $y=x$.
	%TODO: graph
	\subsubsection{Corresponding Key Points}
	A point $P(x, y)$ on the relation $r$ corresponds to the point $P'(y, x)$ on the inverse relation $r^{-1}$. The points $P$ and $P'$ are symmetrical about the line $y=x$.
	%TODO: graph
	\subsubsection{Domain and Range}
	The domain of the inverse relation $r^{-1}$ is the same as the range of the range of the relation $r$; $D_{r^{-1}}=R_r$. The range of the inverse relation $r^{-1}$ is the same as the domain of the range of the relation $r$; $R_{r^{-1}}=D_r$.\\
	A relation $r$ is given by the following mapping diagram:\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]
		\node (n5) {-5};
		\node[below=2pt of n5] (n2) {-2};
		\node[below=2pt of n2] (o) {0};
		\node[below=2pt of o] (p2) {2};
	
		\node[right=45pt of n5] (p7) {7};
		\node[right=45pt of n2] (n3) {-3};
		\node[right=45pt of o] (o2) {0};
		\node[right=45pt of p2] (p1) {1};
	
		\draw[->] (n5) -- (p7);
		\draw[->] (n2) -- (p7);
		\draw[->] (o) -- (n3);
		\draw[->] (o) -- (o2);
		\draw[->] (p2) -- (p1);
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	The domain of $r$ is $D=\set{-5, -2, 0, 2}$ and the range is $R=\set{-3, 0, 1, 7}$.
	The domain of $r^{-1}$ is $D=\set{-3, 0, 1, 7}$ and the range is $R=\set{-5, -2, 0, 2}$.
	\subsubsection{Inverse Relation of a Function}
	Any function is a relation. So, any function $f$ has an inverse relation $f^{-1}$.
	\subsubsection{Algebraic Method}
	To find the inverse of a function:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item write the original function in the form $y=f(x)$
		\item switch the $x$ and $y$ variables
		\item solve the expression for $y$
		\item replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsubsection{One-to-One Functions}
	If the inverse relation of a given function $f$ is also a function, then the function $f$ is called a one-to-one function. In this case: $y=f(x)\Leftrightarrow x=f^{-1}(y)$
	\subsubsection{Horizontal Line Test}
	One-to-one functions pass the horizontal line test (any horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point).
	\subsubsection{Restricted Domains}
	By restricting the domain of a function which is not one-to-one, we may obtain a one-to-one function. For example, the inverse of $y=x^2\text{, }x\geqslant0$
	\subsection{Piecewise Functions}
	\subsubsection{Piecewise-Defined Functions}
	A piecewise-defined function requires more than one formula to explicitly define the function. Each formula is defined on a different interval. The domain of a piecewise-defined function is the union of all the intervals used to define the function.\\
	For example, the function $y=|x-2|$ can be rewritten as $y=\begin{cases}
		x-2&\text{if }x\geq2\\
		-x+2&\text{if }x<2
	\end{cases}$\\
	The heaviside function can be represented as $h(x)=\begin{cases}
		1&\text{if }x\geq0\\
		0&\text{if }x<0
	\end{cases}$\\
	%Graph
	%Step function
	The Dirichlet function can represented as $d(x)=\begin{cases}
		1&\text{if }x\text{ is rational}\\
		0&\text{if }x\text{ is irrational}
	\end{cases}$. Sometimes, $\frac{1}{b}$ (where the rational $x$ is represented as $\frac{a}{b}$) is used instead of 1.\\
	The function $f(x)=1-|x+1|-|x+2|$ can be rewritten as $f(x)=\begin{cases}
		x+x+1+x+2=3x+3&x<-2\\x+x+1-x-2=x-1&-2\leq x<-1\\x-x-1-x-2=-x-3&x\geq-1
	\end{cases}$\\
	$f(x)=\begin{cases}
		1&\text{if }x>0\\
		-1&\text{if }x<0
	\end{cases}$
	
	%more examples
	\subsubsection{Continuity}
	The graph of a continuous function can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper. A continuous function has no holes, finite gaps, or infinite breaks.\\
	For example, to calculate a value of $c$ where the function is continuous: $f(x)=\begin{cases}
		x+c&\text{if }x<2\\
		cx^2+1&\text{if }x\geq2
	\end{cases}$
	\begin{align}
		2+c&=c(2)^2+1\\
		2+c&=4c+1\\
	\end{align}
	%$sometihing belongs here$
	\subsubsection{Absolute Value}
	The absolute value of a function is defined by
	\[|f(x)|=\begin{cases}
		f(x)&\text{if }f(x)\geq0\\
		-f(x)&\text{if }f(x)<0
	\end{cases}\]
	\subsection{Exploring Operations with Functions}
	\subsubsection{Arithmetic Combinations}
	Consider two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Their sum, difference, product and quotient are defined as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(s)$
		\item $(f-g)(x)=f(x)-g(x)$
		\item $(fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)$
		\item $\left(\dfrac{f}{g}\right)(x)=\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, $f\neq0$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Domain}
	The domains of $f+g$, $f-g$, and $fg$ is $D_f\cap D_g$ (the intersection between the domains of $f$ and $g$). The domain of $\dfrac{f}{g}$ is $\set{x\in D_f\cap D_g\mid g(x)\neq0}$

		\item $(f-g)(x)=f(x)-g(x)$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Domain of Sum and Difference of Two Functions}
	The domain of the sum or difference of two functions is the intersection of their domains: $D_{f\pm g}=D_f\cap D_g$

		\item $(f\times g)(x)=f(x)\times g(x)$
	\end{itemize}

		\item $(f\div g)(x)=f(x)\div g(x)$
		\item $\dfrac{f}{g}(x)=\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Domain of Quotient of Two Functions}
	The domain of the quotient of two functions is given by: $D_{f/g}=\set{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x\in D_f\cap D_g\text{ and }g(x)\neq0}$
	\subsection{Composition of Functions}
	\subsubsection{Composition of Functions}
	Any function $y=f(x)$ can be imagined as a machine $f$ who changes the input $x$ into the output $y$:\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw [->] (.5, 0) node [left] {$x$} -- (1,0);
		\draw (1,.25) rectangle ++(1,-.5) node[pos=.5] {$f$};
		\draw [->] (2, 0) -- (2.5, 0) node [right] {$y$};
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	You can connect the output of a machine $g$ to the input of a machine $f$ corresponding to a different function $z=f(y)$:\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node (y) at (2.5,0) {$y$};
		\draw[->] (.5, 0) node [left] {$x$} -- (1,0);
		\draw (1,.25) rectangle ++(1,-.5) node[pos=.5] {$g$};
		\draw[->] (2, 0) -- (y);
		\draw[->] (y) -- (3,0);
		\draw (3,.25) rectangle (4,-.25) node[pos=.5] {$f$};
		\draw[->] (4,0) -- (4.5,0) node [right] {$z$};
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	So you can replace the machines $g$ and $f$ by a new machine $f\circ g$ who changes then input $x$ directly into the output $z$:\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw [->] (.5, 0) node [left] {$x$} -- (1,0);
		\draw (1,.25) rectangle ++(1,-.5) node[pos=.5] {$f\circ g$};
		\draw [->] (2, 0) -- (2.5, 0) node [right] {$z$};
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	The relation $(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$ defines the composition of the functions $f$ and $g$
	\subsubsection{Domain and Range}
	The domain of $f\circ g$ is a subset of the domain of $g$: $D_{f\circ g}=\set{x\in D_g\mid g(x)\in D_f}$. The domain of $f\
	circ g$ consists of the $x$ in the domain of $g$ sugh that $g(x)$ is in the domain of $f$. The range of $f\circ g$ is a subset of the range of $f$

	\subsection{Exploring Polynomial Functions}
	\subsubsection{Polynomial Functions}
	A polynomial function $f(x)$ is defined by: $f(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$, where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $a_n$, $a_{n-1}$, \ldots, $a_2$, $a_1$, $a_0$ are real numbers called the coefficients of the polynomial function
		\item $a_n$ is called the leading coefficient
		\item $a_nx^n$ x is called the leading term
		\item $a_0$ is called the constant term
		\item $n$ is a non-negative integer that gives the degree of the polynomial function
		\item the degree of a polynomial function $n$ is the largest exponent of $x$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Order}
	The terms of a polynomial function can be written in any order because the addition operation is a commutative operation.
	\subsubsection{Specific Polynomials}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For $n=0$, $f(x)=a_0$ is called the constant function
		\item For $n=1$, $f(x)=a_1x+a_0$ is called the linear function
		\item For $n=2$, $f(x)=a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$ is called the quadratic function
		\item For $n=3$, $f(x)=a_3x^3+a_3x^2+a_1x+a_0$ is called the cubic function
		\item For $n=4$, we have the quartic function, and for $n=5$, we have the quintic function
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Operations with Polynomial Functions}
	All four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are defined for polynomial functions
	\subsubsection{Y-Intercept}
	The y-intercept of a polynomial function is equal to the constant term $\text{y-int}=f(0)=a_0$
	\subsubsection{Finite Differences}
	The nth finite differences of a polynomial function of degree $n$ are constant. The constant $c$ is related to $a_n$ and $n$ by $c=n!a_n$
	\subsection{Characteristics of Polynomial Functions}
	\subsubsection{End Behavior}
	For very large $x$ ($x\to\infty$ or $x\to-\infty$), the graph of the polynomial function will resemble the graph of the leading term $a_nx^n$\\
	For example, if $a_n>0$ and $n$ is even, as $x\to\infty$, $y\to\infty$, and as $x\to-\infty$, $y\to\infty$, or if $a_n<0$ and $n$ is odd, $x\to\infty$, $y\to-\infty$, and as $x\to-\infty$, $y\to\infty$.
	\subsubsection{Symmetry}
	A polynomial function is even if all the powers of $x$ are even, or odd if all the powers of $x$ are odd.\\
	For example, $x-x^3+2x^5$ is odd, $2-x^2+3x^6$ is even, and $1+x-x^3+3x^4$ is neither.
	\subsubsection{Zeroes and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A polynomial function of degree $n$ has $n$ zeroes, real or complex
		\item If the coefficients of the polynomial function are real numbers, the complex zeroes come in conjugate pairs; there are an even number of complex zeroes
		\item The number of real zeroes is at most $n$, but these zeroes may be coincident
		\item A polynomial function with an even degree may have no real zeroes
		\item A polynomial function with an odd degree must have at least one real zero
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Turning Points}
	A turning point is the point where increasing changes to decreasing or vice versa. A polynomial function of $n$ has at most $n-1$ turning points
	\subsubsection{Extrema Points}
	Extrema is the plural of extremum. Extremum is either a minimum or maximum, and may be local or global. Each turning point is a local extrema point. A polynomial function with an even degree has either a global minimum or global maximum point. A polynomial function with an odd degree has neither a global maximum or a global minimum point.
	\subsection{Polynomial Functions in Factored Form}
	\subsubsection{Simple Zeroes}
	Some polynomial functions can be factored into the form $f(x)=a_n(x-x_1)(x-x_2)\dots(x-x_{n-1})(x-x_n)$ where $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n-1}, x_n$ are $n$ distinct real numbers and are the zeroes of the function. Here, the function changes sign at each x-intercept and the tangent line at each x-intercept is not zero.
	\subsubsection{Repeated Zeroes}
	Some polynomial functions can be factored into the form $f(x)=a_n(x-x_1)^{m_1}(x-x_2)^{m_2}\dots(x-x_k)^{m_k}$, where $x_1$ is a root with multiplicity $m_1$, $x_2$ is a root with multiplicity $m_2$, and so on. The polynomial function has $m_1+m_2+\dots+m_k=n$ real zeroes ($m_1$ are coincident and equal to $x_1$, $m_2$ are coincident and equal to $x_2$, and so on).\\
	If $m_k$ is odd, the function changes sign at $x=x_k$ and the graph crosses the x-axis. If $m_k$ is even, the function does not change sign at $x=x_k$, and the graph touches the x-axis. If the multiplicity $m_k$ is greater than 1 then the tangent line at $x=x_k$ is horizontal.
	\subsubsection{Non-Real Zeroes}
	A polynomial function with non-real zeroes can be factored as $f(x)=(a_1x^2+b_1x+c_1)^{m_1}(a_2x^2+b_2x+c_2)^{m_2}$, where ${b_k}^2-4a_kc_k<0$. Each trinomial $a_kx^2+b_kx+c_k$ has the same sign for all real numbers $x$.
	\subsection{Transformations of Cubic and Quartic Functions}
	\subsubsection{Cubic Funcitons}
	%The graph
	Cubic functions have the parent function $f(x)=x^3$, and after transformations, may be written as $f(x)=a[b(x-c)]^3+d$
	\subsubsection{Quartic Functions}
	%The graph
	Cubic functions have the parent function $f(x)=x^4$, and after transformations, may be written as $f(x)=a[b(x-c)]^4+d$
	\subsubsection{Power Function(Real Exponent)}
	The power function with a real exponent is defined by $f(x)=x^a\text{; }a\in\mathbb{R}$
	%graph
	\subsubsection{Power Function(Rational Exponent)}
	The power function with a rational exponent is defined by $f(x)=x^\frac{m}{n}\text{; }m\text{ and }n\text{ are integers}$
	%graph
	\subsection{Dividing Polynomials}
	\subsubsection{Division of Natural Numbers}
	If $D$ and $d\neq0$ are two natural numbers, then there are unique numbers $q$ and $r$ such that the relation (called the division statement) $\frac{D}{d}=q+\frac{r}{d}$ or $D=dq+r$ is true; where $0\leq r<d$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $D$ is called the dividend
		\item $d$ is called the divisor
		\item $q$ is called the quotient
		\item $r$ is called the remainder
	\end{itemize}
	If the remainder is 0, then $D$ is divisible by $d$, or $d$ divides evenly into $D$.
	\subsubsection{Division of Polynomials}
	If $D(x)$ and $d(x)$ are two polynomial functions, then there are two unique polynomial functions $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ such that the relation $\frac{D(x)}{d(x)}=q(x)+\frac{r(x)}{d(x)}$ or $D=d(x)q(x)+r(x)$ is true; where $0\leq\deg r<\deg d$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $D$ is called the dividend
		\item $d$ is called the divisor
		\item $q$ is called the quotient
		\item $r$ is called the remainder
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Synthetic Division Algorithm}
	Synthetic division is a shorthand method for dividing a polynomial $P(x)$ by a linear divisor $x-b$.
	%maybe explainn
	\subsection{Factoring Polynomials}
	\subsubsection{The Remainder Theorem}
	If a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by $x-b$, then the remainder is $P(b)$; Proof:
	\begin{align*}
		P(x)&=q(x)(x-b)+r(x)\\
		P(b)&=q(b)(b-b)+r(b)\\
		&=q(b)(0)+r(b)\\
		&=r(b)
	\end{align*}
	For example, when $x^3-kx^2+17x+6$ is divided by $x-3$ and the remainder is 12, you can find the value of k by equating $P(3)=12=3^3-k3^2+17(3)+6=27-9k+51+6=84-9k$, so $9k=72; k=8$
	\subsubsection{The Remainder Theorem, Part II}
	If a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by $ax-b$, then the remainder is $P(\frac{b}{a})$; Proof:
	\begin{align*}
		P(x)&=q(x)(ax-b)+r(x)\\
		P\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)&=q\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\left(a\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)-b\right)+r\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\\
		&=q\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\left(b-b\right)+r\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\\
		&=q\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\left(0\right)+r\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\\
		&=r\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
	\end{align*}
	\subsubsection{The Factor Theorem}
	A polynomial $P(x)$ has $x-b$ as a factor if and only if $P(b)=0$.\\
	For example: $x+2$ is a factor of $x^3+5x^2+2x-8$ because $(-2)^3+5(-2)^2+2(-2)-8=-8+20-4-8=0$
	%Note: you can use the $\pm$ factors of the last term to find factors
	\subsubsection{Integral Zero Theorem}
	If $x=b$ is an integral zero of the polynomial $P(x)$ with integral coefficients, then $b$ is a factor (divisor) of the constant term, $a_0$.
	\subsection{Factoring Sums or Differences of Cubes and Powers}
	\subsubsection{Difference of Two Cubes}
	The difference of cubes identity is: $a^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$\\
	For example: you can factor $x^3-8$ into $(x-2)(x^2+2x+4)$, or $\frac{x^3}{27}-125$ into $(\frac{x}{3}-5)(\frac{x^2}{9}+\frac{5x}{3}+25)$
	\subsubsection{Sum of Two Cubes}
	The sum of cubes identity is: $a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$\\
	For example: you can factor $x^3+1$ int $(x+1)(x^2-x+1)$, or $\frac{x^3}{64}+\frac{8}{27}$ into $(\frac{x}{4}+\frac{2}{3})(\frac{x^2}{16}-\frac{x}{6}+\frac{4}{9})$
	\subsubsection{Difference of Two Powers}
	For any natural number $n$, the following identity is true: \[a^n-b^n=(a-b)(a^{n-1}+a^{n-2}b+a^{n-3}b^2+\dots+a^2b^{n-3}+ab^{n-2}+b^{n-1})\]
	For example: $x^4-16$ can be factored into $(x^2-4)(x^2+4)=(x+2)(x-2)(x^2+4)$
	\subsubsection{Sum of Two Powers}
	For any natural odd number $n$, the following identity is true: \[a^n+b^n=(a+b)(a^{n-1}-a^{n-2}b+a^{n-3}b^2-\dots-a^2b^{n-3}+ab^{n-2}-b^{n-1})\]
	For example: $sdf$ can be factored into $asdf$
	%more examples
	\vspace{.5ex}\\
	General Example: Given that $a-b=4$ and $ab=2$, to find $a^3-b^3$:\\
	\begin{align*}
		a^3-b^3&=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)\\
		(a-b)^2&=a^2-2ab+b^2\\
		\therefore a^3-b^3&=(4)(4^2+3(2))=4(16+6)=4(22)=88

	\subsection{Solving Linear Polynomial Equations}
	\subsubsection{Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
	The polynomial function $P(x)$ of degree $n$ has $n$ zeroes, real or complex. The complete factorization of the polynomial function $P(x)$ is $P(x)=a_n(x-x_1)(x-x_2)\ldots(x-x_{x-1})(x-x_n)$, where $x_1$, $x_2$, \ldots, $x_{n-1}$, $x_n$ are the zeroes, real or complex, distinct or coincident.\\
	The complex zeroes come in conjugate pairs, so $n=r+2m$, where $r$ is the number of real zeroes and $2m\text{, }m\geq0$ is the number of complex zeroes.\\
	To factor $x^4-4x^3+7x^2-4$ if $2$ and $-1$ are two of its zeroes:
	\begin{flalign*}
		\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.5}
		\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
			\multicolumn{1}{r|}{2} & 1 & -4 & 7 & 0 & -12\\
			\multicolumn{1}{r|}{}& & 2 & -4 & 6 & 12\\\cline{2-6}
			\multicolumn{1}{r|}{-1}& 1 & -2 & 3 & 6 & 0\\
			\multicolumn{1}{r|}{}& & -1 & 3 & -6\\\cline{2-5}
			& 1 & -3 & 6 & 0
		\end{array}
	\end{flalign*}
	\subsubsection{Integral Zero Theorem}
	If $x=b$ is an integral zero of the polynomial $P(x)$ with integral coefficients, then $b$ is a factor of the constant term $a_0$ of the polynomial. The zeroes are the same as the roots/solutions of $P(x)=0$
	\subsubsection{Rational Zero Theorem}
	If $x=\dfrac{b}{a}$ is a rational zero of the polynomial $P(x)$ with rational coefficients, then $b$ is a factor of the constant term $a_0$ and $a$ is a factor of the leading coefficient $a_n$
	\subsubsection{Real Zeroes}
	If $a+b\sqrt{c}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are rational numbers and $c>0$ is a zero of a polynomial with integral coefficients, then $a-b\sqrt{c}$ is also a zero of this polynomial
	\subsubsection{Technology}
	In some cases, the real zeroes of a polynomial equation may only be found using technology. For example, you can use technology to find the real zeroes of $x^3+x-1$: a,b, c
	\subsection{Solving Linear Inequalities}
	\subsubsection{Inequalities}
	The inequality symbols $<$ (less than), $\leqslant$ (less than or equal to), $>$ (greater than), and $\geqq$ (greater than or equal to) are used to create inequalities. The solution set is the set of all real numbers that make the inequality a true statement
	\subsubsection{Inequality Properties}
	The inequality $a<b$ is equivalent to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $a+c<b+c$
		\item $ac<bc$, for $c>0$
		\item $ac>bc$, for $c<0$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Simultaneous (Double) Inequality}
	The simultaneous equality $a<x\le b$ is equivalent to $a<x$ and $x\le b$
	\subsubsection{Inequations, Part I}
	The inequation $|E(x)|<a\text{, }a\ge0$ is equivalent to $-a<E(x)<a$
	\subsubsection{Inequations, Part II}
	The inequation $|E(x)|>a\text{, }a\ge0$ is equivalent to $E(x)<-a$ or $E(x)>a$
	\subsection{Solving Polynomial Inequalities}
	\subsubsection{Sign Chart Method}
	To solve $x(x-1)\leq0$
	\begin{flalign*}
		\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.3}
		\begin{array}{r|ccccc}
		x     & &0& &1& \\\hline
		x     &-&0&+&+&+\\\hline
		x-1   &-&-&-&0&+\\\hline
		x(x-1)&+&0&-&0&+\\\hline
		\end{array}\\
		x\in[0, 1]
	\end{flalign*}
	To solve $(x^2-x-2)(x^2+1)(x-3)^3\geq0$, you can factor to $(x-2)(x+1)(x^2+1)(x-3)^3\geq0$
	\begin{flalign*}
	\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.3}
		\begin{array}{r|ccccccc}

			f(x)   &-&0 &+&0&-&0&+\\\hline
		\end{array}\\
		x\in[-1, 2]\cup[3,\infty)
	\end{flalign*}
	\subsubsection{Graphical Method}
	You can graph the polynomial and visualize the inequality.\\
	For example, you can look at the graph of $x(x-1)(x+2)>0$ and see where it is greater than 0
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{axis}[
			axis y line*=left,
			axis x line*=bottom,

	\subsubsection{Algorithm to Solve Polynomial Inequalities}
	To solve an inequality involving a polynomial expression:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Move all terms to one side of the inequality
		\item Factor the polynomial
		\item Use a sign chart or graphical method to find the [sign] of the polynomial
		\item Write the solution

	\setcounter{subsection}{0}
	\subsection{Graphs of Reciprocal Functions}
	\subsubsection{General Rules}
	For a function $f(x)$ and its reciprocal $g(x)=\dfrac{1}{f(x)}$, there are some general rules
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the function $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=a$, the reciprocal function $g(x)$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=a$, and vice versa
		\item If the function $f(x)$ is unbounded ($y\to\pm\infty$) as x becomes unbounded ($x\to\pm\infty$), then the reciprocal function $g(x)$ has the horizontal asymptote $y=0$
		\item If the function $f(x)$ has a horizontal asymptote $y=a$ ($y\to a$ as $x\to\pm\infty$), then the reciprocal function $f(x)$ has the horizontal asymptote $y=\dfrac{1}{a}$
		\item If the function $f(x)$ is increasing/decreasing over an interval, then the reciprocal function $g(x)$ is decreasing/increasing over the same interval
		\item If the function $f(x)$ has a local minimum/maximum at $(a,\,f(a))$, the reciprocal function $g(x)$ has a local maximum/minimum at $(a,\,\dfrac{1}{f(a)})$
		\item If the function $f(x)$ is even/odd/neither, then reciprocal function $g(x)$ is also even/odd.neither
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Rational Functions}
	\subsubsection{Rational Functions}
	A rational function is in the form $f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomial functions.
	\subsubsection{Domain}
	The domain of a rational function is determined by $Q(x)\neq0$.\\
	For example, $f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x-1}=x+1$ where $D=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x\neq1\}$.
	\subsubsection{Y-Intercept}
	The y-intercept for a rational function is the point $(0,\,f(0))$ if 0 is in the domain of $f$.
	\subsubsection{Holes}
	The $x$ values where $Q(x)=0$ do not belong to the domain of the function and must not appear on the graph of a rational function. These values might create holes in the graph of the rational function
	\subsubsection{Vertical Asymptotes}
	The vertical line $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote for the graph of the function $f(x)$ if the value of the function becomes unbounded as $x$ approaches $a$. $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote if $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^-}f(x)=f(a-\epsilon)=\pm\infty$ or $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^+}f(x)=f(a+\epsilon)=\pm\infty$ where $\epsilon$ is extremely small and greater than zero
	\subsubsection{Behavior Near Vertical Asymptotes}
	The value of the rational function is unbounded ($\pm\infty$) as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left and right. To find the unbounded value ($\pm\infty$) of the rational function, substitute $a\pm\epsilon$ for $x$, then you can use one of the following types of limits:
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{1}{\epsilon}&=\infty&\frac{1}{e\epsilon}&=-\infty&\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}&=\infty&\frac{1}{(-\epsilon)^2}&=\infty&\frac{1}{(-\epsilon)^3}&=-\infty
	\end{align*}
	and so on.
	\subsubsection{Horizontal Asymptotes}
	The horizontal line $y=c$ is a horizontal asymptote for the graph of the function $f(x)$ if the vertical distance between the graph and this line approaches 0 as $x$ becomes unbounded ($\pm\infty$). $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=c$ or $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=c$, where $c$ is a finite number.\\
	Some functions may have two different horizontal asymptotes (one as $x\to\infty$ and one as $x\to-\infty$). Rational functions may have at most one horizontal asymptote.\\
	For a rational function $f(x)=\dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}=\dfrac{a_nx_n+\ldots+a_1x+a_0}{b_mx_m+\ldots+b_1x+b_0}$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have the same degree ($n=m$) then the equation has the horizontal asymptote $y=\dfrac{a_n}{b_m}$
		\item If the degree of $P(x)$ is less than the degree of $Q(x)$ ($n<m$) then the equation has the horizontal asymptote $y=0$
		\item If the degree if $P(x)$ is greater than the degree of $Q(x)$ then the equation does not have a horizontal asymptote
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Oblique Asymptotes}
	The line $y=mx+b$ is an oblique (slant) asymptote for the graph of the function $f(x)$ if the vertical distance between the graph and this line approaches 0 as $x$ becomes unbounded ($\pm\infty$).\\
	A rational function has an oblique asymptote if the degree of $P(x)$ is one unit greater than the degree of $Q(x)$. To find the equation of the oblique asymptote, use long divide the rational function to obtain $f(x)=mx+b+\dfrac{c}{R(x)}$. $y=mx+b$ will be the equation of the oblique asymptote.
	\subsubsection{Graph Sketching}
	Use x-intercepts, y-intercepts, symmetry, vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, oblique asymptotes, and sign charts to sketch the graph of a rational function.
	\tsubsubsection{Other Stuff From Class}
	For $f(x)=\frac{x^2-x}{6x^3+x^2-2x}=\frac{x(x-1)}{x(2x-1)(3x+2)}$ and $d=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x\neq0, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{2}{3}\}$. There is a hole at $(0, \frac{1}{2})$, and vertical asymptotes at $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $x=-\frac{2}{3}$. As $x\to-\frac{2}{3}^-$, $y\to-\infty$, and $x\to-\frac{2}{3}^+$, $y\to\infty$. As $x\to\frac{1}{2}^-$, $y\to\infty$, and $x\to\frac{1}{2}^+$, $y\to-\infty$. You can use the leading terms to find the end behavior and find the horizontal asymptote at $y=0$\\

	\subsubsection{Vertical Asymptotes (Infinite Limits)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x<a$, then $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^-}f(x)=\infty$
		\item If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x>a$, then $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^+}f(x)=\infty$
		\item If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, then $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=\infty$
		\item If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large in absolute value but negative by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x<a$, then $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^-}f(x)=-\infty$
		\item If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large in absolute value but negative by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x>a$, then $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^+}f(x)=-\infty$
		\item If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large in absolute value but negative by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, then $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=-\infty$
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Vertical Asymptotes}
	A vertical line $y=a$ is called a vertical asymptote of the curve $y=f(x)$ if $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^-}f(x)=\pm\infty$ or $\lim\limits_{\hspace{1ex}x\to a^+}f(x)=\pm\infty$. A vertical asymptote may have a point of intersection with the graph of the function. The vertical asymptotes are the zeroes of the denominator that are not the zeroes of the numerator.
	\subsubsection{Limits at Infinity}
	If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ sufficiently large, then $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$. If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ sufficiently large in absolute value but negative, then $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=L$
	\subsubsection{Horizontal Asymptotes}
	A horizontal line $y=L$ is called a horizontal asymptote of the curve $y=f(x)$ if $\lim\limits_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=L$. A horizontal asymptote may be crossed or touched by the graph of the function. A curve may have at most two horizontal asymptotes (one for $+\infty$ and one for $-\infty$). If $a>1$, then $\lim\limits_{x\to\pm\infty}\dfrac{1}{x^a}=0$\\
	For the rational function $f(x)=\dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}=\dfrac{a+nx^n+\dots+a_1x+a_0}{b+mx^m+\dots+b_1x+b_0}$:
	\[\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=\begin{cases}
		\dfrac{a_n}{b_m}&\text{if }n=m\\
		0&\text{if }n<m\\
		\text{sign}\left(\dfrac{a_n}{b_m}\right)(\pm\infty)^{n-m}&\text{if }n>m
	\end{cases}\]
	Any rational function behaves as $\left(\dfrac{a_n}{b+m}\right)x^{n-m}$ at infinity
	\subsubsection{Infinite Limits at Infinity}
	If the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large by taking $x$ sufficiently large, then $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty$. Similarly, we may have $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=\infty$, $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=-\infty$, or $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-\infty$\\
	If $a>1$ then $\lim\limits_{a\to\pm\infty}x^a=(\pm\infty)^a$
	\subsubsection{Oblique Asymptotes}
	The line $y=mx+b$ is a linear oblique asymptote for the curve $y=f(x)$ if $\lim\limits_{x\to\pm\infty}\left(f(x)-(mx+b)\right)=0$. An oblique asymptote may be crossed or touched by the graph of the function. A curve may have at most two oblique asymptotes (one for $+\infty$ and one for $-\infty$)\\
	If $n=m+1$, rational functions have an oblique asymptote whose equation can be found by long division: $\dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}=mx+b+\dfrac{R(x)}{Q(x)}$. For non rational functions, you can compute the limits: $m=\lim\limits_{x\to\pm\infty}\dfrac{f(x)}{x}$ and $b=\lim\limits_{a\to\pm\infty}(f(x)-mx)$

	\[f(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\quad a,c\ne0\]
	Case 1: $cx+d$ is not a factor of $ax+b$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Domain: $\set{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x\ne-\dfrac{d}{c}}$
		\item Range: $\set{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x\ne-\dfrac{d}{c}}$

	\subsection{Solving Rational Equations}
	\subsubsection{Rational Equations}
	To solve a rational equation:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item State restrictions
		\item Find the least common denominator (LCD)
		\item Multiply so that all terms are over the LCD
		\item Solve the polynomial equation
		\item Verify with restrictions
	\end{itemize}
	For example: to solve $\frac{x}{x-2}-\frac{2}{x+3}=\frac{10}{x^2+x-6}$, you can factor it into $\frac{x}{x-2}-\frac{2}{x+3}=\frac{10}{(x-2)(x+3)}$. You find the restrictions, $x\neq2,-3$. Then, the least common denominator is $(x-2)(x+3)$. After you multiply, you end up with $\frac{x(x+3)}{(x-2)(x+3)}-\frac{2(x-2)}{(x+3)(x-2)}=\frac{10}{(x-2)(x+3)}$. This is equal to $\frac{x^2+3x-2x+4}{(x+3)(x-2)}=\frac{10}{(x-2)(x+3)}$, which is $x^2+x+4=10$, $x^2+x-6=0$, $(x-2)(x+3)=0$. The solutions for this equation are 2 and $-3$, but since the restrictions for the original equation are $x\neq2,-3$, there are no solutions.
	\subsubsection{Cross Multiplication}
	A rational equation of the form $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}=\frac{R(x)}{S(x)}\Leftrightarrow P(x)S(x)=Q(x)R(x)$\\
	For example, to solve $\frac{x-1}{2x+3}=\frac{x+2}{3x-2}$, you can change it to $(x-1)(3x-2)=(x+2)(2x+)$
	\subsubsection{Shortcut}
	A rational equation in the form $\dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}=0$ is equivalent to $P(x)=0$ if all restrictions are satisfied
	\subsubsection{No Solution}
	A rational equation of the form $\dfrac{\text{constant}}{Q(x)}=0$ does not have any solutions
	\subsection{Solving Rational Inequalities}
	\subsubsection{Rational Inequalities}
	In order to solve a rational (nonlinear) inequality:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item State restrictions
		\item Move all the terms to one side
		\item Multiply the expression by the LCD
		\item Simplify and factor both the numerator and the denominator
		\item Make a sign chart and get the solution set
		\item Verify with restrictions
	\end{itemize}
	%example
	\subsection{Rates of Change of Rational Functions}
	\subsubsection{Average Rate of Change}
	The average rate of change (ARC) over an interval $[x_1, x_2]$, is defined as $\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$, or $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. This is the same as the slope of the secant line from $(x_1, f(x_1))$ to $(x_2, f(x_2))$.
	\subsubsection{Instantaneous Rate of Change}
	The instantaneous rate of change (IRC) is defined as $x_1\rightarrow x_2$, the same function. However, since $x_1$ is approaching $x_2$, it would become $\lim\limits_{x_1\to x_2}\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$. Or, if you use $h$ as the difference between the two $x$ values, $\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$. \\
	For example, to calculate the IRC of Newton's Serpentine $f(x)=\frac{4x}{x^2+1}$ at $x=0$:
	\begin{align*}
		\text{IRC}&=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}\\
		&=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\frac{4h}{h^2+1}}{h}\\
		&=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{4}{h^2+1}\\
		&=4
	\end{align*}
	To calculate the instantaneous rate of change for any point in the graph, you can calculate the difference quotient ($DQ$), $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, then use $\lim_{h\to 0}$ on it.
	\begin{align*}
		DQ&=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\
		&=\frac{\frac{f(x+h)}{(x+h)^2+1}-\frac{4x}{x^2+1}}{h}\\
		&=\frac{4(x+h)(x^2+1)-4x(x^2+2xh+h^2+1)}{h(x^2+1)\left((x+h)^2+1\right)}\\
		&=\frac{4x^3+4x+4hx^2+4h-4x^3-8x^2h-4xh^2-4x}{h(x^2+1)\left((x+h)^2+1\right)}\\
		&=\frac{-4x^2h+4h-4xh^2}{h(x^2+1)\left((x+h)^2+1\right)}\\
		&=\frac{-4x^2+4-4xh}{(x^2+1)\left((x+h)^2+1\right)}
	\end{align*}
	Then, the IRC = $\lim\limits_{h\to 0}DQ$, so you can sub $h=0$ into $DQ$, to end up with IRC $=\frac{-4x^2+4}{(x^2+1)^2}$\\
	For $f(x)=\frac{x-2}{x-5}$:\\
	\begin{align*}
		DQ&=\frac{\frac{x+h-2}{x+h-5}-\frac{x-2}{x-5}}{h}
	\end{align*}
	\tsubsection{AP Component: Partial Fraction Decomposition}
	\tsubsubsection{Partial Fractions}
	By adding two rational expressions such as $\dfrac{2}{x+5}+\dfrac{1}{x+1}$, you get the LCD and simplify, and you get $\dfrac{3x+7}{(x+5)(x+1)}$. The reverse process, of breaking down a rational expression like $\dfrac{3x+7}{(x+5)(x+1)}$ into partial fractions such as $\dfrac{2}{x+5}+\dfrac{1}{x+1}$ is called partial fraction decomposition\\
	We call the rational function $R(x)=\dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\text{, }Q(x)\ne0$ a proper fraction when the degree of $P(x)$ is the same as the degree of $Q(x)$. We assume that $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have no common zeroes.\\
	Partial fraction decomposition depends on the factors in the denominator $Q(x)$ %something
	\tsubsubsection{Case 1: Quotient Contains Distinct Linear Factors}
	
	\tsubsubsection{Stuff from Class}
	Partial Fraction Decomposition is the inverse operation of addition or subtraction of fractions. For example, you can decompose $\frac{2x}{x^2-1}=\frac{2x}{(x+1)(x-2)}$ into $\frac{2x}{(x+1)(x-2)}=\frac{a}{x-1}+\frac{b}{x+1}=\frac{a(x+1)+b(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-2)}$. Since they have the same denominators, $2x=a(x+1)+b(x-1)$. Since each degree of x must have the same value on both sides, the coefficient of $x^1$, 2, mus equal $a+b$, and the coefficient of $x^0$, 0, must equal $a-b$. We can solve this system of equations to obtain $a=1$ and $b=1$.

	\subsubsection{Logarithmic Functions}
	$b^x$ is the exponential function, while $x^n$ is the power function. For the exponential function, the base, $b$, is defined as $b>0$ and $b\neq1$, to get a useful graph. You know you have an exponential function if the $1,2,3\dots n$th differences are all proportional.%example maybe
	For exponential functions, the domain is $x\in\mathbb{R}$, while the range is $y\in\mathbb{R}\mid y>0$. They have a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$, but no vertical asymptote. There is a y-intercept at $y=1$, but there is no x-intercept. Their y-intercept is called an invariance point, as it doesn't change based on the base. Exponential functions are one-to-one functions, so their inverse is also a function.\\
	Their inverse is the log function $f(x)=\log_bx$. They have an invariance point at (1, 0). The domain is $x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x>0$, and the range is $y\in\mathbb{R}$.  They have no y-intercept, but they have an x-intercept at $x=1$. They have a vertical asymptote at $y=0$, but no horizontal asymptote. The limits of the vertical asymptote are $\lim\limits_{x\to0^+}f(x)=-\infty$ if $b>1$, and $\lim\limits_{x\to0^+}f(x)=\infty$ if $0<b<1$.

	\tsubsection{AP Component: Derivative Functions and First Principles}
	\subsubsection{Derivative Functions}
	Given a function $y=f(x)$, the \textit{derivative function} of $f$ is a new function , $f'$ ($f$ prime), defined at $x$ by:
	\[f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\]
	\subsubsection{Differentiability}
	A function $y=f(x)$ is called \textit{differentiable} at $x$ if $f'(x)$ exists. A function $y=f(x)$ is differentiable over an interval $(a, b)$ if the function is differentiable at every number in that interval. The domain of $f'$ is a subset of the domain of the original function. A function is defined over $D_f$, but is differentiable over $D_{f'}$
	\subsubsection{Interpretations of Derivative Functions}
	The slope of the tangent line to the graph of $y=f(x)$ at the point $(a, f(a))$ is given by $m=f'(a)$. The instantaneous rate of change in the variable $y$ with respect to the variable $x$, where $y=f(x)$, at $x=a$ is given by $\text{IRC}=f'(a)$
	\subsubsection{Notations and Reading}
	Lagrange Notation: $y'=f'(x)$, ``y prime'' or ``f prime at x''.\\
	Leibniz Notation: $\od{y}{x}=\od{f(x)}{x}$, ``d y by d x''\\
	$f'(a)=\eval[3]{\dod{y}{x}}_{x=a}$, ``f prime at a equals d y by d x at x = a''
	\subsubsection{First Principles}
	\textit{Differentiation} is the process to find the derivative function for a given function.\\
	\textit{First Principles} is the process of differentiation by computing the limit:
	\[f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\]
	\subsubsection{Non-Differentiability}
	A function is not differentiable at $x=a$ if $f'(a)$ does not exist. If a function $f$ \textit{is not} continuous at $x=a$, then the function is not differentiable at $x=a$. If a function $f$ \textit{is} continuous at $x=a$, then the function may or may not be differentiable at $x=a$
	\subsubsection{Differentiability Point}
	If the function $y=f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=a$, then the tangent at $(a, f(a))$ is unique and not vertical (slope is not $\infty$ or $-\infty$)
	\subsubsection{Corner Point}
	$P(a, f(a))$ is a corner point if there are two distinct tangent lines at $P$, one for the left branch and one for the right branch. For example: \[\begin{cases}
		f_1(x)&x<a\\
		f_2(x)&x>a\\
	\end{cases}\text{ and }f_1'(a)\neq f_2'(a)\]
	\subsubsection{Infinite Slope Point}
	$P(a, f(a))$ is an infinite slope point if the tangent line at $P$ is vertical and the function is increasing or decreasing in the neighborhood at the end of point $P$.
	\subsubsection{Cusp Point}
	$P(a, f(a))$ is a cusp point if the tangent line at $P$ is vertical and the function is increasing on one side of $P$ and decreasing on the other side.

	\setcounter{section}{6}
	\setcounter{subsection}{0}
	\subsection{An Intro to Vectors}
	\subsubsection{Scalars and Vectors}
	Scalars are quantities described completely by a number and a measured unit. Vectors are quantities described by a magnitude (for example length, intensity, or size) and a direction.
	\subsubsection{Geometric Vectors}
	Geometric Vectors are vectors not related to any coordinate system. For example, the directed line segment $\vv{AB}$ where $A$ is the initial, start, or tail point and $B$ is the final, end, terminal, head, or tip point.
	\subsubsection{Algebraic Vectors}
	Algebraic Vectors are vectors that are related to a coordinate system. In general, these vectors are described by their components relative to a reference system, or frame. For example, $\vv{v}=(2,\,3,\,-1)$
	\subsubsection{Position Vector}
	The position vector is the directed line segment $\vv{OP}$ from the origin of the coordinate system $O$ to a generic point $P$.
	\subsubsection{Displacement Vector}
	The displacement vector $\vv{AB}$ is the directed line segment from the point $A$ to the point $B$.
	\subsubsection{Pythagorean Theorem}
	Why is this here
	\subsubsection{Magnitude}
	The magnitude is the length, size, norm, or intensity of the vector. The magnitude of a vector $\vv{v}$ can be denoted by $|\vv{v}|$, $\lVert\vv{v}\rVert$, or $v$.
	\subsubsection{3D Pythagorean Theorem}
	In 3D, the following relation is true: $d^2=a^2+b^2+c^2$
	\subsubsection{Equivalent or Equal Vectors}
	Two vectors are equivalent or equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. For example, $\vv{AB}=\vv{CD}$ in the figure:\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw [thick,-latex] (0,1) node[anchor=east] {$A$} -- (2,1) node[anchor=west] {$B$};
		\draw [thick,-latex] (0,.5) node[anchor=east] {$C$} -- (2,.5) node[anchor=west] {$D$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\subsubsection{Opposite Vectors}
	Two vectors are opposite if they have the same magnitude but opposite direction. For example, $\vv{AB}=-\vv{CD}$ in the figure:\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw [thick,-latex] (0,1) node[anchor=east] {$A$} -- (2,1) node[anchor=west] {$B$};
		\draw [thick,latex-] (0,.5) node[anchor=east] {$D$} -- (2,.5) node[anchor=west] {$C$};
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	As well, $\vv{AB}=-\vv{BA}$.
	\subsubsection{Parallel Vectors}
	Two vectors are parallel if their directions are either the same or opposite. If vectors $\vv{v_1}$ and $\vv{v_2}$ are parallel, you can write $\vv{v_1}\parallel\vv{v_2}$\\
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw [thick, -latex] (0,0) -- (2,2) node [midway,above left]{$\vv{v_1}$};
		\draw [thick, latex-] (1,0) -- (2,1) node [midway,above left]{$\vv{v_2}$};
		\draw [thick, -latex] (2,0) -- (4,2) node [midway,above left]{$\vv{v_3}$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\subsubsection{Direction}
	To express the direction of a vector in a horizontal plane, we can either use:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item True (Azimuth) Bearing, the angle between North and the direction of the vector, measured clockwise. For example, 5m[120$^\circ$]
		\item Quadrant Bearing, the angle between North or South and the vector, towards East or West. For example, 5m[S60$^\circ$E]
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Vector Addition and Subtraction}
	\subsubsection{Addition of Two Vectors}
	The vector addition of two vectors $\vv{a}$ and $\vv{b}$ is denoted by $\vv{a}+\vv{b}$ and is called the sum or resultant of the two vectors
	\subsubsection{Triangle Rule (Tail to Tip Rule)}
	In order to find the sum of two geometric vectors, place the second vector with its tail on the tip of the first vector. The sum is the vector with its tail at the tail of the first vector and its head at the head of the second vector.
	%graph
	\subsubsection{Polygon Rule}
	To find the sum of $n$ geometric vectors, place each vector with its tail at the head of the previous vector.
	%graph
	\subsubsection{Parellogram Rule (Tail to Tail Rule)}
